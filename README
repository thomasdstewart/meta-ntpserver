This is a yocto project (https://www.yoctoproject.org/) layer containing recipes to build an image that can run on a galleon ntp appliance.

This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-ntpserver layer. Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Using 
=====
This layer contains both a distro (ntpserver) and machine (gallean). It's desgined to ceate an eng image for a galleon ntp appliance. However further machines could be added.

To use this the base and dependency repos needs to be created:

```sh
  git clone http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky -b mickledore
  cd poky
  git clone http://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded -b mickledore
  git clone https://github.com/thomasdstewart/meta-ntpserver.git
  . oe-init-build-env
  bitbake-layers add-layer $PWD/../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
  bitbake-layers add-layer $PWD/../meta-openembedded/meta-python
  bitbake-layers add-layer $PWD/../meta-openembedded/meta-networking
  bitbake-layers add-layer $PWD/../meta-ntpserver
```

This adds an image called ntpserver-image. It expects some configuration to be defined in build/conf/local.conf. Add the following to local.conf:

```sh
  echo 'MACHINE = "galleon"' >> conf/local.conf
  echo 'DISTRO = "ntpserver"' >> conf/local.conf
  echo 'ROOT_PASSWORD_HASH = "\$5\$XdEvu3X0DbgNUKqa\$AeAvbpYFcve1nRKoDnXCCRB8Mu8USDQ0Yxqdac94Qq6"' >> conf/local.conf
  echo 'hostname_pn-base-files = "ntpserver"' >> conf/local.conf
```

Password hashes can be set with: "printf "%q" $(mkpasswd -m sha256crypt password)". Modify the meta-ntpserver/recipes-core/server/ntp.conf file to suite needs.

To build run:

   bitbake ntpserver-image

It should produce a working image located in the build dir here:

  tmp/work/galleon-poky-linux/ntpserver-image/1.0-r0/deploy-ntpserver-image-image-complete/ntpserver-image-galleon.wic

To test this with qemu the following can be used:
  runqemu-gen-tapdevs # following advice to run sudo runqemu-gen-tapdevs
  runqemu wic nographic

Which runs something like:
  tmp/work/x86_64-linux/qemu-helper-native/1.0-r1/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0,mac=52:54:00:12:34:02 -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 -device virtio-rng-pci,rng=rng0 -drive if=none,id=hd,file=build/tmp/deploy/images/galleon/ntpserver-image-galleon-20230602072302.rootfs.wic,format=raw -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd -m 256 -serial mon:stdio -serial null -nographic

Which can be written to a USB stick with something like:
  pv tmp/work/galleon-poky-linux/ntpserver-image/1.0-r0/deploy-ntpserver-image-image-complete/ntpserver-image-galleon.wic | sudo dd bs=1M of=/dev/sdb

Once booted from the USB sticl on the real hardware dd the usb to the onboard compact flash with something like:
  dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda_remove_ bs=1M count=200

Post install modifications can be made by remounting rw
  mount -o remount,rw /
  # do modification
  mount -o remount,ro /

Static IP's can be configured to override /lib/systemd/network/80-wired.network in /etc/systemd/network/0-wired.network to override like:
  [Match]
  Name=en*

  [Network]
  Address=192.168.0.10/24
  Gateway=192.168.0.1
  DNS=192.168.0.1

To test gps, telnet to localhost port  2947 and type "?WATCH={"enable":true,"json":true};", eg

  # telnet localhost 2947
  Connected to localhost
